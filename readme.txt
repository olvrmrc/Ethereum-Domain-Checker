[1] Get a private ethereum node (I recommend using https://llamanodes.com/) and save the https endpoint in "settings.json". You can also use the public endpoint, but it will slow the program.
[2] Get the address and ABI of the smart contract and save it to "settings.json". Also choose function which can be used to check wether a domain name is already registered or not. You cant get this information from https://etherscan.io/.
[3] If you want to check specific domain names, put them into a text file and save its name to "settings.json".
[3] Run "checker.py" and follow the instructions.
